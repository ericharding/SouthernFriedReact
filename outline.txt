=============
1. Introduce Eric
   - bts
2. What is F#
   - If you're N talks into an F# conference and you still don't know I can't help you
3. What is Fable?
   - Recommended path?
   - What is Elmish?
4. Elmish is great if you're starting fresh
   We don't usually have that luxury
5. Options
   - Mix/match in one project?
      what boundaries?
   - Needs your team to be onboard
6. A more subversive way?
